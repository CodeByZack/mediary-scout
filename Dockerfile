# media-track self-host image: Next.js app + in-process queue worker
# (started via apps/web/instrumentation.ts). One container = web + worker.
#
# No `# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1` on purpose: this image uses only baseline
# Dockerfile features (multi-stage, COPY --from, ARG), so the external frontend
# buys us nothing — and that directive forces BuildKit to fetch the frontend image
# from Docker Hub at build start, which (a) is the FIRST thing to fail when Hub is
# unreachable and (b) can bypass a configured registry mirror. Dropping it keeps the
# whole build on the mirror once one is set. (See #46.)

# ---- 基础镜像来源 ----
# node:22-slim 来自 Docker Hub,而 **Docker Hub 在中国大陆经常拉不动**
# (`failed to fetch anonymous token: ... EOF` / `connection reset by peer`)。
# 这个 ARG 让墙内用户把它换成公共镜像站,与 docker-compose.yml 的
# DOCKER_MIRROR 共用同一个值:
#
#   docker compose build --build-arg DOCKER_MIRROR=docker.1ms.run web
#   # 或把 DOCKER_MIRROR 写进 .env,compose 会自动传进来
#
# 已实测可用(2026-08-01,大陆直连):
#   docker.1ms.run · dockerproxy.net · docker.m.daocloud.io · hub.rat.dev
#
# **必须在第一个 FROM 之前声明**——FROM 只能引用此前定义的 ARG。
# 且它在每个构建阶段都要重新声明一次(ARG 的作用域到阶段结束)。

# Why: self-host deploys silently kept serving OLD code after a `git pull` — #88–#98
# saw five rebuilds in a row ship a stale image (the box ran a July-2 image for a whole
# day). The exact cause was never definitively pinned (the build logs were lost): a live
# rebuild was seen with `COPY . . CACHED` producing a stale image, yet a clean isolated
# repro on the same router showed COPY re-copies changed source correctly — so it may
# have been a transient poisoned build cache, a no-op `git pull`, or a container that
# wasn't recreated. Rather than bet on one cause, the durable fix makes deploys
# SELF-VERIFYING: stamp the built commit into the image as BUILD_COMMIT so
# scripts/deploy.sh can hard-fail when the running container isn't serving HEAD —
# catching ALL of those failure modes whatever the underlying cause.
#
# GIT_SHA doubles as a cache-bust: an ARG cache-misses on first USE (not on its
# declaration), and a cache miss forces every LATER layer to rebuild. Placed after
# `npm ci` (deps stay cached) and before `COPY . .`, it forces a fresh source COPY +
# build whenever the deployed commit changes. Redundant under BuildKit's content-
# addressed COPY, but cheap and correct — and it genuinely protects self-hosters on a
# classic/legacy builder (`DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0`, or very old Docker) where COPY caching IS
# unreliable. Passed per commit by scripts/deploy.sh (build.args → ${GIT_SHA}); an
# unset value defaults to "unknown".
